Okay hear me out, what if we make a game about a schlimack that is searching for his victim. His victim, you may ask, is a person
that entered a deal with the devil. He would be made filthy rich, with only one minor catch. To the end of his days, a slow moving, 
immortal schlimack would follow him, wherever he goes. If the schlimack touches him, he is dead. YOU ARE THE SCHLIMACK!
